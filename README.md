## Feature

I will show you some of the components that can be expressed in UNY.  
Various things such as buttons and form parts that can be used by itself, things such as lists and cards that can be used as a set.

[View demos](https://unys.github.io/uny/demos/)

> Note: Since it is still in beta, its behavior may be unstable.

## Installation

Via npm

```shell
$ npm install uny -S
```

or download [ZIP](https://github.com/unys/uny/archive/master.zip) file.

## Quick start

In addition to downloading and loading CSS and JS files, you can easily start by using CDN.

Add the following description in the `<head>` tag of the web page you want to use UNY.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/uny@latest/dist/css/uny.min.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/uny@latest/dist/js/uny.min.js"></script>
```

Write the HTML tag of the component you want to use.

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-image" style="background-image: url(https://source.unsplash.com/random);"></div>
  <h3>Heading</h3>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Molestiae, debitis.</p>
  <p><a href="#" class="button">Download</a></p>
</div>
```

This alone displays the card type component with the image embedded ðŸŽ‰
